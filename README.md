# Constant_Current_Valve_Driver
Harware and firmware associated with controlling 4 bistable valves from TTL pulse of various duration. The Pulse is coming from a Pressure controller and its software were only the duration can be set. Different durations trigger different combinations of valves in the context of a microfluidic system.
The valves are bistable and require a pulse of constant current to turn ON/OFF. 
The code can be modified to have any pulse duration and the hardware can be modified to also obtain stable current from 0 to 1.5A.
The stable current is based on a AL8860 ic.
